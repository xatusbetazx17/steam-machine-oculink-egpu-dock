# GPU Fit Worksheet

Fill this out before you finalize the dock enclosure design.

## GPU identity
- GPU model:
- Board partner / brand:
- Cooler type: (open-air / blower / hybrid / AIO)

## Dimensions (measure your specific card)
- Length (mm):
- Height (mm) (PCI bracket to top edge):
- Thickness (slot count):
- Thickness (mm) (optional):

## Power connectors
- Connector type(s): (8‑pin, 12VHPWR, etc.)
- Connector location: (top edge / side / end)
- Extra clearance needed for power plugs? (yes/no, how much):

## I/O ports
- HDMI count:
- DisplayPort count:
- Other:

## Cooling considerations
- GPU intake direction:
- GPU exhaust direction:
- Does the card dump heat inside the case heavily? (most open-air cards do)

## Dock enclosure target class
Choose one:
- [ ] S (≤220mm, ≤2-slot)
- [ ] M (≤300mm, ≤2.5-slot)
- [ ] L (≤330mm, ≤3-slot)
- [ ] XL (>330mm, 3.5–4-slot)

## Notes
- Any special requirements (vertical mount, riser, anti-sag bracket, etc.):
